              <p><em>"Since I've been transferred here, I've decided to build a village from scratch. Every village needs a name though. I think I'll call it...Tarrey Town."
                â€” Hudson</em></p>
              <p>At first, Tarrey Town was an empty peninsula encircled by large rocks and trees. In order to make it what it is today, Link helped Hudson construct the town. This was done through the side quest "From the Ground Up". Hudson asked Link to help him build the town by providing him with wood and tracking down multiple people to assist in the construction whose names ended in "-son".</p>
              <p>It's happy and wonderful and just about the best thing Breath of the Wild.
